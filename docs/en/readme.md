# Documentation for Detrav Recipe Calculator

This application is designed to calculate the number of machines (crafts, devices, nodes) needed for building a particular process. Although it can be used for processes outside of gaming, it was specifically created with Minecraft (GTNH) and Factorio in mind.

The idea originated from the need for precise calculations of production capacity.
